Have you ever wondered what patterns lie hidden in your WhatsApp conversations? With my **WhatsApp Chat Analyzer**, you can now explore your chat data like never before!

## 🔍 Project Overview

The WhatsApp Chat Analyzer is a Python-based tool that parses and analyzes your exported WhatsApp chats. It provides useful insights such as:

- Most active participants
- Message frequency by time/day
- Commonly used words and emojis
- Media and link sharing stats
- Chat sentiment (optional)

## 📁 How It Works

1. **Export your chat** from WhatsApp (without media).
2. Upload the `.txt` file into the analyzer.
3. View detailed visualizations and statistics.

It’s a great way to reflect on conversations, find trends, or even just have fun seeing who sends the most messages 😄

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn / Plotly
- Regular Expressions
- (Optional) Streamlit for UI
